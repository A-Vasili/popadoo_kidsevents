"""Business-role checks shared by views, services, and navigation.

Django superusers are Popadoo Administrators. Owners are ordinary accounts in
Popadoo's Owners group. Keeping those roles separate prevents an Owner from
quietly gaining system-level privileges while still allowing both roles to run
the business through the custom management panel.

# privilege never silently grants unrelated access.
